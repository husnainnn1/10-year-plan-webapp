            <!-- paragraph tag writing an introduction -->
            <p>As a young male in his later teens, I have thought about this question many different times and its' not without saying that eventhough 10 years may seem like a lifetime away, in a few blinks many years would've passed and without me noticing it. It seemed like just yesterday when I started secondary school and today here I am writing this as a project for my first year university work. I have made this website talking about how over the next 10 years I am going to pursue my career,my interests, my education,my emploment and increase in self development.</p>

            <p class="text">The world of computer science is nothing but constant innovation in my eyes. My passion and love for this innovation was awakened from being exposed to countless numbers of devices at a young age ranging from consoles to handheld technology, this drew me to study computer science at GCSE where I discovered the fundamentals of algorithms, programming and computer systems which induced me to further study it at A level and now in Goldsmiths. <br></br></p>
