            <!-- text talking about personal development over the next 10 years -->
            <p>Personal development in my opinion is a lifelong process and it consists of activities that develop a person's capabilities and potential so an example of this may be for some people to make better use of their time managment or network more with other people in their work industury.<br><br></p>
            <p>Self development is a journey that requires effort and commitment. For me as a male individual over the next 10 years, I am going to focus on various areas such as career advancement, personal growth, and relationships. To achieve career success, I am going to set specific professional goals and work towards achieving them through education, training and networking. I also want to focus on improving my leadership and communication skills, this is because in order for me to progress in my career I would need to discuss problems and enquire about different topics from both clients and my work peers . Additionally, I can work on building and maintaining strong relationships with family, friends and colleagues. By committing to a consistent self-development plan, I can achieve a sense of fulfilment and happiness in this life.</p><br>
            <!-- h5 tag talking about a important topic  -->
            <h5>How to build strong relationships?</h5><br>
            <p>I know that building strong relationships with friends and family members takes time and effort. One of the most important things I'm trying to do is to make sure I am communicating effectively. This means I need to actively listening to the other person, being open and honest about my thoughts and feelings, and making an effort to understand their perspective. Additionally, it's important to make time for one another and to make sure that I am spending quality time together. This can include things like going on trips together, taking part in shared hobbies and interests, or simply spending time at home together. With a combination of effective communication, shared experiences, and genuine care, I am of the opinion that I can build and maintain strong relationships with friends and family members over the next 10 years.</p>

            <h2 class="textTitle">Gym</h2>
            <p class="text">In my opinion, gym is really good when it comes to self development, this is because there has been a strong scientific evidence that being physicallly active can aid to healthier and happier life. Not only that by it scientific research has also shown that physical activity carried out within the gym raises levels of various brain chemicals e.g. endorphins that leaves an individual being more relaxed and anxious </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">For me gym is necessary in order to improve myself over the next 10 years, so over the next 10 years I plan on working out either in the gym or my house consistently over the week which means atleast 4x per week and will aim to have below 12% body fat; this is mostly because in my previous years I have always felt insecure when it comes to my body so I beleive a low level body fat will increae my confident when around my work peers or around others in general. Not only that but I think it'll also show my consistency when working hard as to achieve this body type it'll take multiple years of eating right and working out.  </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">In conclusion, for personal growth I plan on focusing on developing a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly, eating well, and managing stress. </p>
