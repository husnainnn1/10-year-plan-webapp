        <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
        <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?
          My website talks about how over the next 10 years I'm going to improve myself as an individual, so this includes self development physically and mentally. Physical self development includes going to the gym,eating a good diet and staying consistent whereas mentally it includes improving my mindset to a more career orientated one and developing many of the skills I hold such as communicating skills. I approached this subject by giving a long think and planning out the next years to come and how I am going to achieve the goals I have set for myself over the next few years and to put them in action or to be constantly reminded of them I decided to write them out on a piece of paper.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Who is your audience?
          <br>
          I believe my audience for this website will be other students or other individuals in the age range of 18 - 24. I have selected this demographic because I am of the view that these ages would want to read my website about my future goals so they if they are stuck in on their career path and to improve themselves, they are able to learn from how I've planned out my journey to improve themselves in all aspects of their lives not just in their career so this may involve upholding strong relationships with work colleagues, family or friends.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Portfolio 1 : Michelle Ovalle - The deisgn for this website was really simplistic with it being eqipped with a project page, an about page and a writing page. One part of my website that has been derived from this is the use of only a small amount of pages to describe about oneself and show its' portfolio. I have used this part for my project aswell because as my target audience are quite young and also being in that age group of the target audience, I do not want to bore them with the use of countless pages all filled with writing as I know many of them will not stay read pages on end about ones 10 year journey, also due to this I have used images to give a understanding of what the text besides it says</li>
          <li>Portfolio 2 : Jessica Hernandez -  The design for this was much more complicated than the first portfolio I looked at, this is because this portfolio not only described itself but used various colours,various writing fonts, many different shapes in the wrting and different font weights. I took using different colours and font weights for different titles and background colour in the pages from this portfolo wesbsite. I am of the opinion that different colours on different elements of the pages, makes the user attracted to the website and makes the whole website appealing. Along with that,helping visitors to navigate through the site is one key role colour plays, guiding them through the site content easily and quickly. </li>
          <li>Portfolio 3 : Nad Chishtie - This individual is a UK- based digital product designer. This website is very unique in my opinion and this is because the wesbite design is really neat with a contrasting black and white design, where the individual has a black background and white text writing and is also introducing himself on the welcome page. As this design was really futuristic I decided to go with a similar colourway to give an aesthetic look to my website aswell, my background on all the pages is black followed by white text writing explaining the rest of it. I have also introduced myself on the opening page of my website.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p><br>
        <p>I have made the site easy to use by using different colours and buttons, these can make a website easy to use and navigate by providing visual cues to the user. For example, using a consistent color scheme one on a singular page can help users identify different sections of the website and buttons can be used to guide users through the website's flow. Additionally, different colors and button styles have been used to indicate different states (e.g. hover, active, visited and different cursor pointers) which can help users understand where they have been and where they can go next. This has made the website more intuitive to use and help users to find the information they are looking for more quickly.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Learning - I leanrt a lot of ways to style my pages differenlty while takig part in that 11 hour course that I have referenced in the end of the page, I am of the view that I would not have been able to make my website work well and look pleasing without the help of this course</p>
        <p>Libraries and other resources - I have not included any libraries or other resources in my work </p>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The 3 things that I believe have worked really in well in my work are the use of styles, being able to differentiate between sub pages within the website and the use of pictures.
          The use of pictures on a website can make it better for the user in several ways:
          1)Visual appeal: pictures has made my website more visually appealing and engaging, which will grab the user's attention for a longer period of time.
          2)Clarity: pictures have helped to communicate information more clearly and effectively, particularly when combined with text. This will be able help users to understand the content of the website more easily.
          3)Accessibility: pictures have been used to provide alternative information for users who have visual impairments, for example, by providing descriptive captions for images.
          Overall, the use of pictures can help to make a website more visually appealing, engaging, and effective at communicating information, which can lead to a better user experience.

          Moreover, the use of different styles which have been used to position and give a colourway to each image,text or button has made my website work well in several ways:

          1)Hierarchy: Text and images are used to create a visual hierarchy on the website, which has helped users understand the importance of different pieces of information. This has been achieved by using different font sizes, colors, and styles to indicate headings, subheadings, and body text.
          2) Balance: Text and images are  positioned in a way that creates a balanced layout, which has made the website appear more visually appealing and easy to navigate. This has been achieved by using negative space and aligning elements in a way that creates a sense of symmetry.
          3)Contrast: Text and images have been used to create contrast on the website, which has helped to draw the user's attention to specific elements. This is achieved by using different colors, textures, and patterns to create a visual interest.
          4)Flow: Text and images are positioned in a way that guides the user's eye through the website, which can help to create a sense of flow. This has been be achieved by using visual cues such as shapes e.g. rectangle for the box to direct the user's attention.

          Furthermore, I think he colourways has made it easier for the user to navigate and realise what page they are currently on.

          The 3 things that i would change if I had more time would be, I would add more videos to my website,interactive elments e.g. what they think of my goals, feedback page which users can recommend new ideas for my page or help me improve my goals/website.
