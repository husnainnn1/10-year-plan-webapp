            <h5 class="myeducationTitle">My Education</h5><br>
            <p> My education journey started in 2009, where I started primary school. As a young kid I had no ambition on what I wanted to do as an adult but all that seemed too far away to even think about but the years went by in what seemed like couple seconds and I grew up. I realised when I started secondary school in 2015 that I had a growing love for computer science and technology, since I was the oldest brother I had to make sure that I picked a sensible career which would make up for my parents expectations and a career path my sibings would look up to aswell but life didn't happen the way I expected it do. As the first couple years of secondary went by with good grades but come around year 10 where I started hanging around with the wrong crowd where I was always in some sort of fight or drama up to a point where I was getting excluded from school so as expected my grades was dropping and by the end of year 10, my grades and mock results were grade 4 or below. </p>
            <p>In semptember 2019 is when I started year 11 and I was slowly coming to the realisation that if I did not put my head down I wouldn't get into a good sixth form and could possibly spoil many years to come. With this thought in my head I decided that it was best I start revising and working hard, at this point I was determined to make my parents proud and get into a good sixth form and I was seeing my coninous 3 hours of revision paying off, by the start of march 2020 all my predicted grades were 6+ with most of them being 7s and 8s. Not long after this is when COVID-19 hit and the whole of the UK was in lockdown and I felt like all my efforts had gone down the drain all because the government didn't give clear instructions on how the GCSEs was going to take place but I didn't let this distract me from my career.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>All the free time during lockdown gave me the ability to further enhance my wisdom within the coding industry and I successfully advanced my coding skills for Python, CSS and HTML5 through the aid of online resources such as freeCodeCamp. I often attempted to enhance my programs in python or build new ones from scratch; throughout my experience, I have developed critical thinking upon reaching every dead end which I believe is a crucial skill to have in order for me to construct a strong position during my time at universityÂ . Additionally, I took part in a 5 day coding challenge by FutureLearn who taught CSS and HTML5 over several videos, reading materials and examined me upon my new knowledge which gave me an insight into the world of a web programmer, the complexities of making a website and enabled me to familiarise myself with major parts of website development. I was and still am of the view that this additional learning will positively affect my understanding of coding languages in university.In the end government decided to give us the grades our teachers thought we would've achieved, when I collected my results I was happy with most of the grades received but unhappy with a couple e.g. Spanish where I was predicted a 6 but was given a 5 instead but my grades got me into a sixth form of my choice. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In Semptember 2020, I started my sixth form journey where I intially started studying A level Physics, Computer Science and Maths but two months into the course I came to terms with the fact that A level physics was not a subject I was going to enjoy and do well in hence I dropped it and picked up A level Sociology instead.I had choosen these specific subjects because I believed that these would give me an entrance into a really good univeristy for computer science.
                Due to me knowing how important these next 2 years will be for my future, and being in a fresh school with no one I knew before meant that I was able to build a friendship group consistening of others who had similar life goals as me and also wanted to succeed in their career, this in the end allowed me to achieve good grades and today here I am in Goldsmiths Univeristy. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In September 2022, I started my University journey and I plan on getting this bachelors degree and start working in my field, I don't plan on taking further education e.g. masters or PHD after I attain this degree </p><br>
            <!-- h5 tag with title "Employment Journey" followed by p tags talking about my future employment goals -->
            <h5 class="employmentTitle">Employment Journey</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Until 2033, I plan on staying in one successful tech company such as BNY MELLON, pwc, IBM, CGI or google in which I can climb to a higher position e.g. manager. I'm going to apply to these companies once I have my bachelor degree but to increase my chnace of acceptance I feel like it is vital for me to gain work experince in the technology field hence I am going to work a placement year within in the next 2 <br> </p>
            <p>The reason why I want to stay in one place over the next 10 years is because once the time does come to leave and apply for a new job, a lot of employeers will consider me over other applicants as a long time in a company will portray my loyalty, work dependability and work ethic in a work enviornment. Not only that but staying in one company comes along with many benefits that includes access to special job benefits and much more </p>
